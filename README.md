# Code-Quiz-Repo
A timed quiz on JavaScript basics. The quiz page shows a timer and the user's current score.  There is a link to view the high score page.  When the text in the middle of the header is clicked the quiz begins.

The quiz consists of five questions about basic JavaScript functionality.  Correct answers add one point to the user's score while incorrect answers deduct 10 seconds from the timer.

When the game ends- either by answering all of the questions or running out of time- the user is prompted to enter their initials.  Upon submission of their initials they are directed to a page containing previous user scores.  Below the scores are two buttons: one to clear the saved scores and one to direct the user to the quiz page to play the game again.
